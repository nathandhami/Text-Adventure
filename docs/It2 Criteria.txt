Initial requirements for Iteration 2
=====================================

UI
* A clean interface that separates the player’s text entry from the feedback from the server and allows them to proceed without interfering.

Networking
* The connection between clients and the server works
* Multiple clients can connect

World interaction tasks
* Look
* Look at keywords in room
* Look at objects, players, or NPCs in room
* Look at keywords associated with objects, players, or NPCs in room
* Look at exits
* Look at keywords associated with door
* Look at objects in inventory
* Look at keywords associated with objects in inventory

* “go”, “move” <direction> or “go”, “move” door keyword
* <direction> alone as shorthand
* Doors are flexible and need not be one of the 4 cardinal, 4 intercardinal, or 2 vertical directions. If the “direction” of a door is “inside”, then typing “go inside” should take the player through that door. There is no limit on directions.

* The player can get items from the room that they are in and collect them in an inventory
* Items in the inventory that “fit” or can be “wielded” by the player can be worn and used by the player

* As one player does things (gets items, fights NPCs, enters/exits a room) other players in the room should be updated/notified.

Flexible commands
* Connection between the spelling of a command and the action performed by that command can be specified via yaml
* Some commands are only available to players with desired authentication levels

World resets
* Every area/zone resets by executing the specified reset commands with a frequency either specified as part of the area or as a configured default.

World construction via commands
* Players with appropriate administrative privileges can create new areas/zones, rooms, doors, objects, NPCs, reset commands, etc. OR modify existing ones

Player attributes & development
* Players have characteristics like
* an inventory
* appropriate items worn in appropriate places, e.g. a shirt on their torso.
* strength, intelligence, dexterity, charisma
* a measure of experience that can be affected by winning fights, completing quests, or other tasks
* a current level that can change based on changes to experience
* a description of what other players see when that look at a player
* skills and associated proficiencies in those skills

Combat
* Players can fight NPCs
* If a player wants to, they can opt in to fight & be fought by other willing players.
* Rounds of a fight proceed until one party loses or flees
* Damage and defence are determined by attributes & equipment of the player(s) and/or NPCs

Configurability
* There should be no magic values, so a configuration file controls
* The port of the server to which players connect
* The default reset time for areas
* Any other global options
